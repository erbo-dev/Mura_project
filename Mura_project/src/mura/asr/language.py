"""Which languages a transcript is actually written in.

Whisper reports one language per request. A MURA recording is routinely two:
«Менің әжем Алматыда тұрды, потом мы поехали к ней летом» is one sentence in
two languages, and a single `language` field cannot describe it.

This module therefore does not guess and does not ask a model. It reads the
text that was actually produced and reports what is demonstrably present:

  * nine graphemes exist in Kazakh Cyrillic and not in Russian, so any of them
    is direct evidence of Kazakh;
  * closed-class function words are the densest, least ambiguous marker of
    either language, and appear in essentially every real sentence.

Both signals are observable in the string. Nothing here is inferred from a
confidence score the recogniser never reported.
