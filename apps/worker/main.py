"""Standalone recording worker.

The API process used to run the worker on a background thread, which coupled two
very different lifecycles: a request-serving process that should start instantly
and scale on demand, and a job runner that holds a lease for many minutes. This
entrypoint separates them. The API now only submits and reads jobs; this process
claims and executes them.

Safety rests on the lease from PR-02B-i, not on shutdown bookkeeping. If this
process dies mid-recording -- SIGTERM, power loss, anything -- the lease simply
expires and another worker reclaims the job. Nothing here ever marks in-flight
work completed or failed just because the process is stopping.
