 * Home, before there is an archive.

 * An empty archive is the state every family starts in, and it was being served
 * by one grey sentence under a heading — on a 1440px window that left most of
 * the screen blank at the exact moment the user has the least idea what to do.
 *
 * So this is not an "empty state" in the apologetic sense. It is the first-run
 * screen: it says what the next five minutes look like, and it hands over four
 * questions, because "press record and talk to your grandmother" is a much
 * harder instruction to follow than it sounds. The questions are the same ones
 * the recorder offers, so nothing here is invented for the empty case.
 *
 * Nothing on it counts anything. There is no archive to summarise yet, and a
 * row of zeroes is how a family archive starts looking like a dashboard.
