/**
 * The one thing this product is for, given the weight of it.
 *
 * ## What it replaces
 *
 * A black circle floating in beige with two lines of grey text under it, and a
 * separate list of counts somewhere off to the right. Nothing on the page was
 * dominant, nothing was asked of the user, and the archive's own size — the
 * fact that a family has *nine people and three generations* in here — was a
 * detail in a sidebar.
 *
 * ## Why it is filled
 *
 * The palette's strongest move is near-black on warm ivory, and this is the
 * screen's one place to spend it. A filled block does three things a card
 * cannot: it makes the page have a subject, it gives the record control a
 * ground that is not the same colour as everything else, and it stops the
 * archive's counts from reading as dashboard statistics — set on ink, under a
 * question, they read as the size of what the family has built.
 *
 * The question matters more than the button. «Что вы хотите сохранить сегодня?»
 * is a prompt to a person; «Записать воспоминание» is a label on a control.
