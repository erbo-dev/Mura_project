/**
 * The first thing anyone sees.
 *
 * ## What this replaces
 *
 * A wordmark, one line of tagline and a single «Начать» that walked straight
 * into `/home`. At 1440 it was a narrow strip of type against most of a screen
 * of empty paper, and it never said what the product does or offered the two
 * things a visitor actually arrives wanting: start one, or get back into mine.
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * Two columns from `lg`: the words on the left, the generations motif holding
 * the right and running past the edge of the viewport. The motif is the
 * signature — overlapping circles whose shared area is the memory two
 * generations both carry — and it is doing the work the empty half used to do.
 *
 * Below the fold, three steps in the order they happen. Deliberately not
 * numbered: «01 / 02 / 03» would assert a sequence the visitor must complete,
 * and this is a description of what the product does, not a checklist.
 *
 * Stacked on a phone, where the motif is held to the upper band so it sits
 * behind the wordmark and tagline only. Centred over the full height it landed
 * squarely under the two calls to action and made the sign-in link hard to
 * read, which is the one control a returning visitor must never hunt for.
